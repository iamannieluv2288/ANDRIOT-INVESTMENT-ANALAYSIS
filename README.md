This end-to-end analytics project was developed for Adriot Investment Limited to enhance financial oversight and budget compliance across its departments and ongoing projects. The objective was to create a data-driven budgeting analysis framework that could proactively identify financial risks and support more informed budgetary planning.

The project focused on delivering interactive visualizations and strategic insights by integrating multiple data sources, such as employee records, departmental budget allocations, salary expenses, and project cost details. By doing so, the dashboard empowered stakeholders to monitor, assess, and act on budget utilization in near real-time.

OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of this project were to:

•	Create visualizations using SQL queries to highlight projects and departments within ADRIOT INVESTMENT LIMITED that are at risk of exceeding or falling below their budget.

•	Demonstrate the structure of various data sources, including employee information, salary data, department budgets, and project details.

•	Assess whether each department's one-year budget allocation can sufficiently cover expenses, given that departmental budgets are set at two-year intervals.
METHODOLOGY
1. Requirement Gathering: Collaborated with finance and operations teams to define key objectives: track budget compliance, identify financial risks, and assess long-term sufficiency.
2. Data Collection & Preparation: 
•	Integrated data from multiple sources: employee records, salary data, department budgets, and project costs.
•	Cleaned and structured data using SQL for consistency and accuracy.
3. Data Modeling & Analysis:
•	Developed SQL queries to calculate key KPIs:
•	Budget Utilization (%)
•	Overrun Risk Flags
•	Budget Sufficiency Scores
•	Normalized and joined datasets for department- and project-level insights.
4. Dashboard Development:
Created interactive dashboards using Power BI with:
•	Visual risk indicators for departments/projects.
•	Drill-downs by department, time period, and budget category.
•	Heatmaps and scorecards for quick decision-making.

KEY INSIGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS
1. Monthly Project Budget Fluctuation:
•	March records the highest budget utilization (80K), while February has the lowest (45K).
•	The data reveals irregular budget distribution, with sharp rises and dips between months.
 Interpretation:
This suggests a lack of consistent project rollout or unplanned expenditures occurring during peak months.
2. Departmental Budget vs. Capital Utilization:
•	Sales: Highest departmental cost at $150K; remains financially healthy with $116K capital.
•	Marketing: Costs $115K; maintains a positive capital of $369K, indicating efficient budget use.
•	Human Resources: Spends $105K but runs a capital deficit of ($25K), indicating overspending.
•	Engineering: Strong capital balance ($770K) despite substantial spending ($110K).
•	IT: Lowest expenditure ($90K) and low capital ($58K).
Interpretation:
Engineering is over-funded relative to current spending, while HR’s overspending could suggest uncontrolled or underestimated expenses. IT may be underfunded, risking infrastructure degradation.
3. Project Status Distribution:
•	Completed Projects: 365K of the total budget (64%)
•	Upcoming Projects: 205K (36%)
Interpretation:
A healthy portion of the budget is allocated to completed work, but it’s crucial to monitor whether completed project budgets matched planned estimates.

4. Top Projects by Budget:
•	Product Launch leads with 80K, followed by Brand Repositioning and Mobile App at 70K each.
•	CRM Integration and SEO Optimization receive lower allocations (50K), suggesting secondary strategic importance.
 Interpretation:
Focus is on customer engagement and digital transformation. However, projects related to operations (CRM, SEO) may need reevaluation for sufficient resource allocation.
5. Department Goals & Project Alignment:
•	Sales: “Boost Sales” – aligned with the highest project funding.
•	Marketing: “Increase Brand Awareness” – well-funded.
•	HR: “Enhance Employee Engagement” – capital deficit suggests misalignment between goal ambition and funding.
•	IT: “Improve Infrastructure” – underfunded considering importance.
Interpretation:
Strategic goals are broadly aligned with budgets, but funding inconsistencies could hinder goal achievement, particularly in HR and IT.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Enforce Consistent Budget Phasing:
•	Introduce quarterly planning to distribute project funds more evenly and avoid large spikes like in March.
•	Implement budget reforecasting tools to adapt in real-time to project delays or accelerations.
 Impact: Improves predictability and prevents month-end cash flow strain.
2. Rebalance Departmental Capital Allocation:
•	Reduce surplus in Engineering and reallocate part to HR and IT.
•	Ensure HR gets appropriate funding to avoid further deficits and preserve employee satisfaction initiatives.
•	Boost IT investment to support long-term digital infrastructure.
 Impact: Optimizes use of resources across strategic units and prevents stalling of crucial operations.
3. Review Project Execution Costs:
•	Analyze completed project budgets vs. actual outcomes to identify patterns of overspending.

•	Use this data to refine project estimation models and increase accuracy.
Impact: Enhances accountability and improves future cost projections.
4. Enhance Monitoring of Goal-Budget Alignment:
•	Develop a goal-tracking dashboard that connects budget utilization directly to goal progress metrics (e.g., employee satisfaction, sales growth, brand engagement).
•	Flag departments where capital usage does not correlate with performance outcomes.
 Impact: Ensures ROI-based budgeting and reduces wasteful expenditure.
5. Invest in Underfunded Strategic Areas:
•	Projects like CRM Integration and SEO Optimization are critical for data-driven marketing and digital presence but are under-resourced.
•	Consider incremental funding based on performance triggers (e.g., user engagement metrics).
Impact: Strengthens digital transformation and competitive edge.
