This end-to-end analytics project was developed for Adriot Investment Limited to enhance financial oversight and budget compliance across its departments and ongoing projects. The objective was to create a data-driven budgeting analysis framework that could proactively identify financial risks and support more informed budgetary planning.

The project focused on delivering interactive visualizations and strategic insights by integrating multiple data sources, such as employee records, departmental budget allocations, salary expenses, and project cost details. By doing so, the dashboard empowered stakeholders to monitor, assess, and act on budget utilization in near real-time.
